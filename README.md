## Algorithm Patterns Catalog

A structured catalog of algorithmic patterns for interview preparation. 

When first starting with LeetCode, the large number of problems can feel overwhelming. Solving problems randomly takes a lot of effort and is often quickly forgotten. Focusing on algorithmic **patterns** instead of individual problems makes learning more efficient and helps build **lasting intuition**. This project organizes patterns and shows an interactive graph linking patterns to problems, making it easier to navigate coding interviews.

## What This Tool Aims To Do

🧩 Group LeetCode-style problems by pattern  
🔍 Show problem to pattern relationships via an interactive graph  
🧠 Help build intuition, not just solutions, for faster interview preparation
