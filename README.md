## Algorithm Patterns Catalog

A structured catalog of algorithmic patterns for interview preparation. 

When first starting with LeetCode, the large number of problems can feel overwhelming. Solving problems randomly takes a lot of effort and is often quickly forgotten. Focusing on algorithmic **patterns** instead of individual problems makes learning more efficient and helps build **lasting intuition**. This project organizes patterns and shows an interactive graph linking patterns to problems, making it easier to navigate coding interviews.

## What This Tool Aims To Do

🧩 Group LeetCode-style problems by pattern  
🔍 Show problem to pattern relationships via an interactive graph  
🧠 Help build intuition, not just solutions, for faster interview preparation

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help improve the catalog:

### Patterns
1. Open the `patterns.json` file. It contains all patterns and sub-patterns.  
2. Add a new entry if you think a pattern or sub-pattern is missing.  
3. Make sure it makes sense to create a separate sub-pattern rather than merging with an existing one.  

### Problems
1. Open the `problems.json` file. It contains all cataloged problems.  
2. Add or update the `patterns` for a problem that can be solved using a specific sub-pattern, or for which a sub-pattern is important for its optimal solution.  
3. Prefer adding only the sub-patterns that contribute to the best or most optimal solution for the problem.
